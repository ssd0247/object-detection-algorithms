# Folder contents
---

> This folder contains **weights of the pretrained classification models** used in the overall object detection task.

> The classification models are provided with the windows-sized, pieces of the whole image, at different scales greater than the `minSize` *(hyperparameter, value variations juggle the tradeoff between accuracy and speed)*.

>> NOTE: This folder contents aren't under the supervision of version control, because they are weights pertaining to hefty models. And thus takes a lot of space.
